        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <pre>
        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as
        a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java 
        compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
        licenses.
